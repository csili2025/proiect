  Tetris is a well-known puzzle game where players control falling shapes called tetrominoes. Each shape is made of four squares, and the goal is to arrange them to form complete horizontal lines. When a line is full, it disappears, and the player earns points. As the game continues, the speed increases, making it more challenging. The game ends if the pieces reach the top of the screen. I created my own version of Tetris in Java, keeping the original gameplay while adding smooth controls and improvements.
  My Tetris game has three different panels and two levels of difficulty. The background music plays continuously, and there are sound effects for movement and clicking actions, making the gameplay more engaging. Players can move and rotate the falling tetrominoes to complete horizontal lines and earn points. Players can register, and their scores and playtime are saved in a database. The system keeps track of the top 10 players, ranking them based on their points and time. The game offers a dynamic and immersive experience while maintaining the classic Tetris mechanics.
